## Project Workflow
I really like your read me alot. It's very well though out. I like how you described your process and things you want to do moving forward.

## Technical Requirements
You're SO close to an MVP its not even funny. I think with another day you woulda figured it out on your own for sure. But I'd love to pair on it with you at some point. But honestly, you've figured out most of the logic for this app, it just needs to do the DOM manipulation that you want.

## Creativity
I love this color scheme! I wouldn't worry too much about this category. Honestly I'm more pleased with how far students get on their MVP then the creativity aspect.

## Code Quality
For the most part, you're code is properly indented. But comments, you really need comments in your code! Future Kristin will be alot happier with past Kristin is she comments code.  Additionally it could help for refactoring potentially down the road. IE these comments look eerily similar I should probably abstract this functionality and DRY up my code base.

## Problem Solving
I really like the concentration game, because its implementation is a strong exercise in problem solving. Like I said before, you're really close to an MVP. So I think you solved the over arching problem, the only thing left is that last bit of DOM manipulation.

## Total
Meets Expectations- Overall. Great job on your first project. You're super close to an MVP. I think you learned alot this week, and I'm SUPER happy with the progress you've made in the last two weeks. Great Job! Keep up the hard work!
